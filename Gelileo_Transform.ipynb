    "The following is my own extension to the physics text referenced above, but thinking with integrals\n",

    "What about integral? According to:\n",
    "https://www.allthescience.org/what-is-integral-calculus.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Calculus is used to describe how a function (f) changes in relation to time (t). If the velocity (v) of a particle is defined by the function v = f(t), then how far it has traveled can be worked out using integration, because this is equal the area under the curve. The distance traveled between two distinct points can be found using a definite integral.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So in our case, we could try the following, the thinking is instead of using position vectors to formulate things, we will try using v = f(t) to model things, and using integral instead of differentiation to model the Gelileo Transform scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $$[a,b]$$ denotes the time interval between the inertial frame transformation, we define the same distance variable for velocities as below:\n",

    "1) the velocity of the moving inertal frame\n",

    "the distance of the inertial frame travels is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Vt= \\int _a^b f_0 dt $$\n",

    "2) the veolocity of the moving object inside the frame at time 0\n",
    "$$V = f(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the distance the moving object tranvels is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\int _a^b f dt $$\n",

    "3) the relative velocity of the moving object inside the frame at time t, which can be written as: \n",
